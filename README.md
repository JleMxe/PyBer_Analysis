# Overview of the PyBer Analysis
The purpose of the analysis is to utilze the provided ride sharing data files to create a summary of the data by city type tracked weekly. Also, to provide an analysis of what the summary may be indicating.
# Results of the PyBer Analysis
The provided data files were used to create a single summary dataframe that could be used as a source a graphical representation as well as a data table. The data table can be seen below. It contains all the weekly fares delineated by city type. Also there is a summary of all the data associated by city type.

Below is a graphical representation of the summary data to more intuitively recognize what the data indicates.

A close look at the graph reveals some interesting points. 

-The most obvious being that the total fares are greatest in the Urban area followed by the Suburban regions with the Rural areas coming in last.

-There is an uptick in total fares towards the end of February across all three city types. 

-The Rural and Suburban trends tend to follow each other while the Urban trend tends to be, overall, more volatile and doesn't follow the other two trends.

-There is a period in early to mid-April that is consistently higher and more stable in the Urban trend than in the others.

-The average fare per driver is greatest in the Rural areas. The Urban areas have the greatest total fares sue to a much higher population density as well as more drivers to service the location.

# Summary of the PyBer Analysis
In consideration of the above analysis, the following recommendations are being put forth:
-Since the Rural area has the greatest revenue per driver and is the most stable market, the number of drivers for that aare should be increased slightly and the data monitored. Too many drivers would be inadvisable due to the lower population density. However, a slight increase in driver numbers could generate and overall increase in revenue due to the ability to take market share from competitors.
-Due to the increase in fares across all city types in late February, it is being recommended that the driver count for all areas be increased during this period. This is also to take advantage of market share currently being underserved as well as serviced by competitors.
-Due to the volatile nature of the Urban trend, the recommendation is to publish a survey int he urban areas to determine why there appears to be a cyclical nature to the market in late February thru the beginning of April. An opportunity may present itself in that the market may be underserved in this time period and require more drivers to stabilize the revenue stream.
